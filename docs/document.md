GUIDE: Proof of Acquisition “Document”:
Evidence of Traction and Adoption is a core criterion for this Hackathon. A project without users
is not a startup; it is just a weekend project. You must demonstrate that you have generated
genuine interest during the event.
The more the jury will feel that your users truly tried and resonate with your product the better.
Remember it's not just about numbers, showing that one of your posts got 100 likes may not
always be as valuable as an in-depth feedback from one user. Your ideas may also have
different context: market size, business models... ONE potential customer can be a young dad
looking for clothes or a company with 200 employees looking for information, 1 != 1;
Below you will find a list of Metrics examples, don’t try everything and nothing. Select the
metrics you think are the most important to track for your specific case, and only then track them
and share them.
It is up to you to tell your story with both quantitative and qualitative data collected from
your very own users.

Reddit).

Pilot programs).

launches).
