# LeadSwap - Pitch Deck Structure

## Slide 1: Title Slide
*   **Logo** LeadSwap
*   **Tagline:** The First Agentic Lead Exchange.
*   **Team Names**

## Slide 2: The Problem (Context)
*   **Data Decay:** B2B databases are static. 30% of data decays every year.
*   **No Context:** You get a name and an email, but no context on *why* they need your product now.
*   **Manual Grunt Work:** Sales Reps spend 40% of their time researching, not selling.

## Slide 3: The Solution (LeadSwap Agent)
*   **Dynamic Sourcing:** We don't query a database; we query the live web.
*   **Deep Qualification:** An autonomous agent visits the website like a human would.
*   **Instant Context:** Why this lead? "Recruiting 5 sales reps", "Just installed Stripe", "Website is down".

## Slide 4: Under the Hood (The "Magic")
*   **1. Neural Search (Exa.ai):** Finds companies based on meaning, not keywords.
    *   *Input:* "Find me e-commerce brands with ethical vibes."
*   **2. Autonomous Verification (Lightpanda):** Headless browser visits the URL.
    *   *Action:* Checks for specific keywords, technologies, or visual elements.
*   **3. Agent Orchestration (Dust):** Synthesizes the data and presents actionable insights.

## Slide 5: Demo / User Journey
*   **Step 1:** User chats with Agent "I need leads for my SEO agency."
*   **Step 2:** Agent suggests specific criteria "Should we target sites with low Lighthouse scores?"
*   **Step 3:** Agent runs the search & enrichment loop.
*   **Step 4:** User gets a table of verified leads with "Context Snippets".

## Slide 6: Market & Potential
*   **Target:** B2B Agencies, SaaS Sales Teams, Growth Hackers.
*   **Why Now?** LLMs allow us to "understand" a website's content at scale for cheap.

## Slide 7: Roadmap (The Hackathon & Beyond)
*   **Today:** Functional MVP with Search + Enrich loop.
*   **Tomorrow:** Automated Outreach integration (Email drafting based on site content).
*   **Future:** The "Swap" Market - Users trade their discarded leads with others who value them.

## Slide 8: Call to Action / Team
